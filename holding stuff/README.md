Background: Merchandising Display division has special needs or processes compared to regular 
converting plants. 
	MD receives orders for specific quantities usually less in magnitude. 
	Every order might have to go through series of steps or machine jobs. 
	At each step there is some waste (of paper) based on the machine family and the order 
	characteristics (such as dimensions, grade, flute, qty, etc.) 

So, what happens when there is a wastage? 
	If the wastage is more than the estimated quantity, it might lead to shortages and 
	thereby has to rerun the order to fulfill the order quantity. 
	More wastage means more loss for SW 

Incorrect estimations may lead to either more wastage or overage both of which incur 
loss to SW
